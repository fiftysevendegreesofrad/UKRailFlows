    <h1 class="display-4">Interactive maps of UK rail flows:<br/>Visualising costs and times</h1>
    <p class="lead">These interactive maps accompany the Green Alliance report <i>Next Stop, Better Rail</i>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Generalized costs assume a value of time of &pound;15/hour. Real values of time vary considerably depending on the traveller and trip purpose (usually less than this for leisure trips and more for business trips).
    </li>
    <li>Train costs are median values paid for a sample of ticket sales without railcards, reflecting a mixture of walk-up and advance tickets.</li>
    <li>Train times are median values based on sampled customer departure times.</li>
    <li>Car fuel costs are estimates from Trainline. Individual cars vary substantially in fuel costs. There are also further costs of owning a car besides fuel (depreciation, maintenance etc), but these maps use fuel cost alone as it is likely to have the greatest influence on mode choice for an individual trip.</li>
    <li>
    Full details of the method and data sources can be found in the technical report.
